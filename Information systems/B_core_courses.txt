Operating System Concepts
Course goal: To learn about the basic principles of modern operating systems that affect software performance and fair distribution of computing resources. Course objectives: To master the fundamental components of operating systems architecture, and practice evaluating operating system performance depending on various configuration parameters. The operating system is an essential component of any computer system. This course does not cover specific operating systems or hardware, but fundamental concepts that are applicable to any operating system. The following questions are answered: what are operating systems, what do they do, how are they designed, and how has the concept of the operating system evolved historically? The course covers the basic concepts of process and CPU planning, memory management, secondary and tertiary memory structure, protection and security, as well as computer system performance evaluation. Language of the course implementation: Latvian.
