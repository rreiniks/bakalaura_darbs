Discrete mathematics for computing
The aim of this course is to acquaint the students with the basic mathematical notions which are not dependant on the notions of limit and continuity, and are at the mathematical foundations of computing and to help acquire the basic skills in their usage.
The course tasks are: to learn the basics of mathematical logics (propositions, predicates, quantifiers, normal forms, mathematical induction), set theory (sets, correspondences, mappings, binary relations), modular arithmetics, combinatorics (graphs, rules of sum and product, sieve and pigeonhole principles, the most common types of selections and their numbers), probability theory (event algebra, classical and statistical definitions of probability function, probability axioms, rules of sum and product, sieve principle, conditional probability and independence of events), to develop skills in solving the simplest problems in these areas, to learn to recognize which notions are applicable in a solution of the particular problem.

Calculus I
The purpose of the course is to help students learn to use the tools of mathematical analysis to solve various problems of a mathematical and physical nature. At first the objects of mathematical analysis are functions. In nature, technology, economy, etc. We encounter movements, processes that can be considered as functions - hence the objective need to study functions.
Tasks of the course "Calculus I": limit theory, differential calculus, integral calculus and their applications.

Analytical geometry
In this course the basic results of Euclidean geometry are considered that are based on coordinate method and vector calculus which are useful for establishing a mutual relation between numbers and pints and between equations and geometric shapes (lines, surfaces). Vector calculus, transformations of plane and space, properties of lines and planes as well as second order surfaces are discussed in this course.
The goal of this course is to develop mathematical way of thinking, formal description of geometrical properties also for the purpose of implementing the desired calculations in software.
Course tasks:
Learn the main results and applications of analytic geometry.
Develop the algebraic way of approaching geometrical problems.
Obtain a wider notion about the geometrical analysis of the plane and the space.
