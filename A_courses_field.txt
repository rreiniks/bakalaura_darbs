Databases and Information Systems Fundamentals
Goal of this course is to introduce students to main concepts of relational databases and information systems, as well as to teach students how to create databases and make manipulations with data.
The objectives of the course are to acquaint with the advantages and functionality of databases. The task of the course is to give an idea of the concepts of relational databases, as well as to teach students to perform operations in the database - creating a database and tables, inserting, changing, deleting data in a database, making data selection. The aim of the course is to teach students the mathematical foundations of the relational model - functional dependencies and normal forms. Students also need to learn how to build an ER model and create an appropriate database structure.
Students learn the components, types and architectures of information systems. Several specific types of information systems are introduced - ERP, CRM, BPM, BI. Students learn about various information systems created by Internet technologies, as well as related problems - security and globalization.

Web Technologies II
The goal of the course is to learn server-side web technologies. The course provides an overview to the history of web programming and examines the fundamental web site development technologies – server side scripts, data bases, web server configurations. The popular technologies are included in the course – PHP scripting language, MySQL database engine and Apache web server. In the practical part of the course, students develop a simple web site by creating both the client side interface, and the server side scripts. The work is carried out individually or in small teams. The development simplifies digesting of the theoretical part of the course by getting to know the practical principles of web development.
Tasks of the study course:
To acquire knowledge about server-side web technologies.
To learn to develop a web application in practice, using both server and client side web technologies.

Automata Theory
The goal of the course is to acquaint with mathematical models used to investigate principal possibilities of computers and programs, to define syntax of programming languages and to build parsing algorithms. Finite automata (transformers and acceptors), nondeterministic acceptors, regular expressions and regular languages, as well as their interconnection are considered. Many examples are given to illustrate these concepts. Special attention is paid to development of synthesis skills of automata and explanation of connection of automata theory to the practical programming.
The goal of the course is to acquaint with the basic concepts of automata theory and their interrelation, as well as to acquaint with the methods of analysis and synthesis of finite automata, acceptors, and regular expressions.
